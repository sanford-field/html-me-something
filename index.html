        This article explains how a bridge is fit to a violin at the violin shop.  It
        is intended as an explanation for the generally interested, not as an instructional resource.
        I only miminmally explicate the tools used to do the various jobs, and I don't discuss mearurements 
        much (since they're mainly of interest to luthiers).  The intention here is to provide an understanding 
        of the process without getting bogged down in the technical details, of which there are many!  
        </p>
    <p>For the time being, I have no illustrative pictures of the various steps I will 
        be describing, so I have included pictures of my dog.  These will be replaced later,
        although I might leave one or two in for fun.

            Before crafting a violin bridge, the luthier chooses an appropriate bridge blank.
            Bridge blanks are violin bridge sized pieces of maple that are crudely shaped approximations
            of a finished violin bridge.  Like a lot of raw materials, they are available in various levels of quality.  The two major 
            bridge blank manufacturers, Aubert and Despiau, have different grading systems for their blanks, 
            which are essentially rated from 1 - 5 in terms of grain direction, hardness, and general quality.
            Unless you are a student luthier (<em>and</em> your bridges will not be used as part of a functioning instrument), 
            only the three highest levels are acceptable.  For the bridge in our example, I will be carving a 
            Despiau blank from their highest level, so hopefully I don't mess it up!  
        </p>

        <p>
            The first step in carving a violin bridge is planing a blank to the appropriate
            thickness.  A bridge that is too thin will collapse under the downward pressure
            exerted by the strings, and a bridge that is too heavy will muffle the sound of the violin.
            Different luthiers have different ideas about what the optimal finished thickness should be,
            but violin bridges are almost all between 4.2 and 5 mm thick.  Since I am using a good
            blank made of hard, high quality maple, I will make this bridge 4.45 mm thick, give
            or take a few hundredths of a millimeter.  My target, finished thickness will be somewhere
            between 4.4 and 4.5.  I leave extra material to remove during the finishg steps.
        </p>

        <p>
            After setting the thickness of the bridge, the bridge feet must be carved to fit the top (also known
            as the table) of the violin.  Bridges are not attached to the violin - rather, they are 
            held in place by string tension.  In order for bridges to stay put, they must fit the arching
            of the violin, the shape of which is curved both front to back and side to side!  The feet are carved
            close to the final shape with a knife, and then finished with a tool called a scraper (used
            in conjunction with carbon paper), to create an exact match to the violin!  It is important that
            bridges fit quite exactly.  Poor bridge foot fit results in diminished volume, distortion of 
            tone quality, and bridges that won't stay put.  
        </p>

        <img src = dog-pics/IMG_E4354smol.jpg alt = "Sleeping dog">

        <p>
            After fitting the feet, the projection is drawn onto the bridge.  The projection is 
            an imaginary measurement of where the fingerboard would intersect the bridge if it were 
            longer.  It can be drawn onto the bridge by sighting down the fingerboard while holding the 
            bridge in place, or using a ruler.  Both approaches have their pro's and con's, but in the 
            end, producing an accurate projection onto the bridge is what is important.  
        </p>

        <img src = dog-pics/IMG_4321smol.jpg alt = "Blanket dog">

        <p>
            Next, the top of the bridge is marked onto the bridge blank.  This mark determines the 
            "action" of the violin.  A string instrument's action is a slightly complicated issue,
            but a simple working definition is how far out of a straight line the strings have to
            be pressed to make a note.  Now you can see why marking the fingerboard projection
            precisely is so important!  
        </p>

        <p>
            After describing the top of the bridge with a line (made by tracing a template), 
            I remove the excess material by sawing and filing it off.  At this point, I will make
            provisional grooves for the strings in the top of the bridge and check the accuracy of 
            my work.  I try to leave a bit of excess when setting the string height.  More material
            can always be taken off, but a bridge that is cut too short must be discarded.  
        </P>

        <img src = dog-pics/IMG_E4498smol.jpg alt = "Sweater dog">

        <p>
            At this point the bridge is nearing completion.  For decorative as well as tonal purposes,
            I now excise excess wood from the bridge.  I open up the heart and kidneys and shape the legs
            and ankles at this point.  Doing this carving takes extra time, but pays dividends in 
            both tone and responsiveness AND makes bridges look beautiful, which luthiers and
            attentive players appreciate.  
        </p>

        <img src = dog-pics/IMG_E4264smol.jpg alt = "Dog nose">

        <p>
            I finish my bridges the with files, first making the front and back flat(ish)
            and coplanar, then polishing the maple to a high shine with a very fine file.  I reinforce
            the E string slot with parchament, which prevents the E string from cutting into the bridge.  
        </p>
